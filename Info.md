The purpose of this project is to create a program that will allow to track
progress for Doom WADs. The contents should be malleable and fit each player
as needed. The progress tracker would have checklists and let the player make
notes. Project is to be made in Python and Swift. Potential usage of the
program may extend beyond Doom.
